# The Persistent Myth

One of the most enduring myths about the Middle Ages is that people during this period believed the Earth was flat. This misconception has been so thoroughly embedded in popular culture that many people today assume medieval scholars were ignorant of basic geographical facts.

The reality, however, is quite different.

## What Medieval Scholars Actually Knew

### Ancient Greek Knowledge

The spherical shape of the Earth was established by ancient Greek philosophers and mathematicians:

- **Pythagoras** (6th century BCE) was among the first to propose a spherical Earth
- **Aristotle** (4th century BCE) provided observational evidence, noting how ships disappeared hull-first over the horizon
- **Eratosthenes** (3rd century BCE) not only knew the Earth was round but calculated its circumference with remarkable accuracy

### Medieval Understanding

This knowledge was never lost during the Middle Ages:

- **Bede the Venerable** (8th century) described the Earth as a sphere in his works
- **Medieval universities** taught the spherical Earth as standard curriculum
- **Thomas Aquinas** (13th century) discussed the Earth's spherical shape in his writings

## Primary Sources and Evidence

Medieval texts consistently refer to the Earth's spherical nature:

- **The Sphere of Sacrobosco** (13th century): A widely used astronomy textbook that described the Earth as spherical
- **Dante's Divine Comedy** (14th century): The entire structure of Hell, Purgatory, and Paradise depends on a spherical Earth
- **Medieval maps**: While stylized, many showed understanding of Earth's curvature

## Where Did This Myth Come From?

The flat Earth myth about medieval times appears to have originated much later:

### 19th-Century Origins

- **Washington Irving's biography of Columbus** (1828) popularized the false idea that Columbus had to convince people the Earth wasn't flat
- **Anti-Catholic sentiment** in Protestant countries led to depicting the "Dark Ages" as more ignorant than they were
- **Enlightenment propaganda** portrayed medieval times as backwards to highlight their own "progress"

### The Real Columbus Story

Christopher Columbus faced opposition not because people thought he'd fall off the edge of the world, but because:

- Scholars correctly calculated that Asia was much farther than Columbus claimed
- They knew the Earth was larger than Columbus estimated
- They feared he would die of starvation before reaching land (which nearly happened)

## Medieval Achievements in Geography

Far from being ignorant, medieval scholars made significant geographical advances:

- **Al-Biruni** (11th century) calculated Earth's circumference to within 15 km of the actual value
- **Islamic geographers** created detailed maps and geographical treatises
- **Medieval travelers** like Marco Polo provided extensive geographical knowledge

## Conclusion

The idea that medieval people believed in a flat Earth is a modern myth that doesn't match historical evidence. Medieval scholars were well aware of Earth's spherical shape, building on ancient Greek knowledge and making their own contributions to geographical understanding.

This myth serves as a reminder to question popular assumptions about the past and to consult primary historical sources rather than accepting simplified narratives about "dark" or "ignorant" ages.
