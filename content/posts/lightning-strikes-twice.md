# The Popular Saying

"Lightning never strikes the same place twice" is one of those phrases that has transcended its literal meaning to become a metaphor for rare, unlikely events. People use it to suggest that if something bad has already happened in a particular location, it won't happen again.

But is this meteorological claim actually true?

## The Science of Lightning

### How Lightning Forms

Lightning is an electrical discharge that occurs when there's a buildup of electrical charge in the atmosphere. The process involves:

- **Charge separation** in storm clouds due to ice particles colliding
- **Step leaders** of electrical charge moving downward from clouds
- **Return strokes** that create the visible lightning bolt we see

### Why Lightning Strikes Where It Does

Lightning follows the path of least electrical resistance, which means it's attracted to:

- **Tall objects** like trees, buildings, and towers
- **Conductive materials** such as metal structures
- **Elevated terrain** including hills and mountaintops
- **Areas with less air resistance** due to atmospheric conditions

## The Reality: Lightning Does Strike Twice

### Famous Examples

**The Empire State Building**: This iconic New York skyscraper is struck by lightning approximately 25 times per year. During severe storms, it can be hit multiple times in a single event.

**The Eiffel Tower**: Paris's famous landmark is struck by lightning several times annually, with some storms producing multiple strikes in quick succession.

**Roy Sullivan**: Known as the "Human Lightning Rod," this park ranger was struck by lightning seven documented times between 1942 and 1977, surviving all encounters.

### Scientific Evidence

Research and documentation show that lightning repeatedly strikes:

- **The same buildings** during single storms
- **Tall structures** year after year
- **Specific geographical locations** that create favorable conditions

## Why the Myth Persists

### Probability Misconceptions

People often confuse two different probability concepts:

1. **The odds of being struck by lightning** (about 1 in 15,300 in a lifetime)
2. **The odds of the same location being struck twice** (much higher for tall, isolated objects)

### Confirmation Bias

We tend to notice and remember rare events more than common ones, making repeat lightning strikes seem more unusual than they actually are.

### Metaphorical Usage

The phrase has taken on a life of its own as a figure of speech, often used without consideration of its literal accuracy.

## Lightning Safety Facts

Understanding lightning behavior is crucial for safety:

### High-Risk Locations

- **Golf courses** with isolated trees and metal equipment
- **Open fields** where you might be the tallest object
- **Bodies of water** which conduct electricity well
- **Tall buildings** without proper lightning protection systems

### Protection Measures

- **Lightning rods** provide a safe path for electrical discharge
- **Faraday cages** (like cars with metal frames) offer protection
- **30-30 rule**: Seek shelter if thunder follows lightning by 30 seconds or less

## The Bottom Line

The saying "lightning never strikes the same place twice" is definitively false from a scientific standpoint. Lightning frequently strikes the same locations, especially tall, isolated, or conductive objects. The Empire State Building alone disproves this myth dozens of times each year.

Understanding the true nature of lightning behavior is not just scientifically interestingâ€”it's essential for proper safety precautions. Rather than relying on folk wisdom, we should base our understanding of natural phenomena on scientific observation and data.

The next time you hear this phrase, remember that lightning is quite happy to strike the same place twice, thrice, or even more times under the right conditions.
